@book{Lewis:1998aa,
	abstract = {From the Publisher:This graduate text provides an authoritative account of neural network (NN) controllers for robotics and nonlinear systems and gives the first textbook treatment of a general and streamlined design procedure for NN controllers. Stability proofs and performance guarantees are provided which illustrate the superior efficiency of the NN controllers over other design techniques when the system is unknown. New NN properties, such as robustness and passivity are introduced, and new weight tuning algorithms are presented. Neural Network Control of Robot Manipulators and Nonlinear Systems provides a welcome introduction to graduate students, and an invaluable reference to professional engineers and researchers in control systems.},

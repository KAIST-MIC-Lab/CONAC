## About this Research

The objective of this research is to design neuro-adaptive controller using constrained optimization theory. 
The main features are as follows.

- Stability of controller is ensured in the sense of Lyapunov.
- Weights of neural network and tracking error are bounded over time.
- Constraints are satisfied while adaptation (learning)
    - Weight norm constraint.
    - Control input saturation constraint (which is convex).

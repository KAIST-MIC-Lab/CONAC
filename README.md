# Constrained Optimization-Based Neuro-Adaptive Control (CoNAC)

> Currently, papers are submitted to __IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems__ and __European Control Conference (ECC) 2025__ and under review. 

## About this Research

The objective of this research is to design neuro-adaptive controller using constrained optimiztion theory. 
The main features are as follows.

- Stability of controller is ensured in the sense of Lyapunov.
- Weights of neural network and tracking error are bounded over time.
- Constraints are satisfied while adaptation (learning)
    - Weight norm constraint.
    - Control input saturation constraint (which is convex).
